In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Specifically, it involves strong references within blocks or completion handlers. If a block strongly captures an object that's already being deallocated, a crash or unexpected behavior can occur. This is often difficult to debug because the crash may happen sometime later after the object seems to have been released. Consider this example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)doSomething {
    __weak MyClass *weakSelf = self;
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ 
        //Strong self within the block
        MyClass *strongSelf = weakSelf; 
        if(strongSelf) {
            strongSelf.myString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, from block!"];
            // ... more operations which may be deallocating this object elsewhere...
        } 
    });
}
@end
```

In this code, the strongSelf captures self. However, if self gets deallocated before the block is executed, referencing strongSelf will lead to a crash.  The `__weak` and `strongSelf` pattern is a common strategy but may still have pitfalls.
