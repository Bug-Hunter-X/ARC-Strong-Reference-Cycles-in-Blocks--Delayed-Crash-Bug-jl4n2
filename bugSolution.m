The solution involves correctly using weak references to avoid strong reference cycles within blocks.  The corrected code looks like this:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)doSomething {
    __weak MyClass *weakSelf = self;
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ 
        // Check if self is still alive before accessing it.
        if(weakSelf) {
            weakSelf.myString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, from block!"];
            // ... more operations ...
        } 
    });
}
@end
```

By only using `weakSelf` within the block, we prevent a strong reference cycle. If `self` is deallocated before the block runs, `weakSelf` will be nil, preventing a crash.  This approach ensures safe access to the object within the block, addressing the potential for delayed crashes.  Note that in many cases, accessing the object through weakSelf may no longer be necessary after the check `if(weakSelf)`.
